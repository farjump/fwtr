Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
FAILED [MEDIUM] KlogAcpiFadtGasBitWidthTooLong: Test 1, MEDIUM Kernel message: [
0.000000] ACPI Error: Gpe0Block - 32-bit FADT register is too long (32 bytes,
256 bits) to convert to GAS struct - 255 bits max, truncating (20131115
/tbfadt-202)

ADVICE: The Generic Address Structure bit_width was greater than 31 which is too
large for a 32 bit ACPI FADT register and was truncated.

Kernel message: [ 0.004170] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.141646] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

Kernel message: [ 0.158674] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S1_] (20131115/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S1 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S1 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S1 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

Kernel message: [ 0.158685] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S2_] (20131115/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S2 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S2 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S2 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

ACPI Warning: 0x0000000000001828-0x000000000000182f SystemIO conflicts with
Region \PMIO 1 (20131115/utaddress-251)

ADVICE: A resource conflict between an ACPI OperationRegion and a native driver
has been detected. By default the kernel will use a strict policy and will not
allow this region to conflict and -EBUSY will be returned to the caller that was
trying to allocate the already claimed region. If an ACPI driver is available
for this device then this should be used instead of a native driver, so
disabling the native driver may help. (Note that the lpc_ich driver can trigger
these warnings, in which case they can generally be ignored). One can specify
kernel boot parameter acpi_enforce_resources=lax to disable these checks but it
may lead to random problems and system instability. Alternatively, one can
specify acpi_enforce_resources=no and ACPI Operation Region resources will not
be registered.

FAILED [LOW] KlogAcpiSystemIOConflictLpcIchWatchDogTimer: Test 1, LOW Kernel
message: [ 8.206334] lpc_ich: Resource conflict(s) found affecting gpio_ich

ADVICE: A resource conflict has occurred between ACPI OperationRegions and the
same I/O region used by the lpc_ich driver for the General Purpose I/O (GPIO)
region. Sometimes this GPIO region is used by the firmware for rfkill or LED
controls or very rarely for the Embedded Controller System Control Interrupt.
This may require deeper inspection to check if the conflict will lead to any
real issues. However, in the vast majority of cases this warning can be ignored
as no harm will occur.

This test verifies if the firmware has put a recent revision of the microcode
into the processor at boot time. Recent microcode is important to have all the
required features and errata updates for the processor.
The kernel did not report that CPU 0 has had a microcode update. The current
firmware is revision 0x1c and probably has not been updated.
The kernel did not report that CPU 1 has had a microcode update. The current
firmware is revision 0x1c and probably has not been updated.

settings.
FAILED [MEDIUM] CPUFreqSpeedMismatch: Test 1, Maximum scaling frequency 1.901000

BIOS in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies does
not match the expected maximum CPU frequency 1.300000 GHz that the CPU can run
at. This usually indicates a misconfiguration of the ACPI _PSS (Performance

specification.

pciirq: PCI IRQ Routing Table test.

Test 1 of 1: PCI IRQ Routing Table test.
This test tries to find and sanity check the PCI IRQ Routing Table, as defined
by http://www.microsoft.com/taiwan/whdc/archive/pciirq.mspx and described in
pages 233-238 of PCI System Architecture, Fourth Edition, Mindshare, Inc.
(1999). NOTE: The PCI IRQ Routing Table only really knows about ISA IRQs and is
generally not used with APIC.

mpcheck: MultiProcessor Tables tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The kernel is using the ACPI MADT for SMP configuration information, so the
Multiprocessor Tables are not used by the kernel. Any errors in the tables will
not affect the operation of Linux unless it is booted with ACPI disabled.

NOTE: Since ACPI is being used in preference to the Multiprocessor Tables, any
errors found in the mpcheck tests will be tagged as LOW errors.

ADVICE: (for Warning #3104, ASL_MSG_RESERVED_NO_RETURN_VAL): A reserved method
returned a value however it is not expected to return anything, so this does not
conform to the expected behaviour. The kernel will most probably ignore the
return value, so this is not going to produce any run time errors.

PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device9 of type LCD has max cooling state 100 and
current cooling state 0.
FAILED [MEDIUM] NoFanCurState: Test 1, Fan present but has no cur_state present.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device5 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device6 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device7 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device8 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device
states. It could be that the devices are returning static information back to
the driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware
using System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined
may not work anyway.
