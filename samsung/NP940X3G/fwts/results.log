--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
Kernel message: [ 0.014506] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.141590] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

Kernel message: [ 0.146654] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S1_] (20141107/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S1 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S1 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S1 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

Kernel message: [ 0.146660] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S2_] (20141107/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S2 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S2 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S2 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

FAILED [MEDIUM] KlogAcpiAlThresholdInvalid: Test 1, MEDIUM Kernel message: [
0.492181] ACPI: Invalid active2 threshold

ADVICE: The ACPI thermal driver has attempted to evaluate an ACPI active
threshold control _ALx and this failed to evaluate. This is normally due to
broken or buggy _ALx control. This may lead to sub-optimal thermal control.

Found 1 unique errors in kernel log.

aspm: PCIe ASPM test.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 2: PCIe ASPM ACPI test.
PCIe ASPM is not controlled by Linux kernel.

ADVICE: BIOS reports that Linux kernel should not modify ASPM settings that BIOS
configured. It can be intentional because hardware vendors identified some
capability bugs between the motherboard and the add-on cards.


Test 2 of 2: PCIe ASPM registers test.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 00h:1Ch.02h L0s not enabled.
WARNING: Test 2, Device 02h:00h.00h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit
latencies, while providing substantial power savings. Disabling L0s of a PCIe
device may increases power consumption, and will impact the battery life of a
mobile system.

PASSED: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting matched was matched.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 00h:1Ch.03h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit
latencies, while providing substantial power savings. Disabling L0s of a PCIe
device may increases power consumption, and will impact the battery life of a
mobile system.

FAILED [MEDIUM] PCIEASPM_Unmatched: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting was not matched.
RP 00h:1Ch.03h has ASPM = 02h.
Device 03h:00h.00h has ASPM = 03h.

ADVICE: ASPM control registers between root port and device must match in order
for ASPM to be active. Unmatched configuration indicates software did not
configure ASPM correctly and the system is not saving power at its full
potential.

pages 233-238 of PCI System Architecture, Fourth Edition, Mindshare, Inc.
(1999). NOTE: The PCI IRQ Routing Table only really knows about ISA IRQs and is
generally not used with APIC.

mpcheck: MultiProcessor Tables tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The kernel is using the ACPI MADT for SMP configuration information, so the
Multiprocessor Tables are not used by the kernel. Any errors in the tables will
not affect the operation of Linux unless it is booted with ACPI disabled.

NOTE: Since ACPI is being used in preference to the Multiprocessor Tables, any
errors found in the mpcheck tests will be tagged as LOW errors.

Failed to find the Multiprocessor Table data, skipping mpcheck test.
NOTE: Since the ACPI MADT is being used instead for SMP configuration, this is
not a problem.

Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
Kernel message: [ 0.014506] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.141590] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

Kernel message: [ 0.146654] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S1_] (20141107/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S1 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S1 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S1 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

Kernel message: [ 0.146660] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S2_] (20141107/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S2 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S2 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S2 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

FAILED [MEDIUM] KlogAcpiAlThresholdInvalid: Test 1, MEDIUM Kernel message: [
0.492181] ACPI: Invalid active2 threshold

ADVICE: The ACPI thermal driver has attempted to evaluate an ACPI active
threshold control _ALx and this failed to evaluate. This is normally due to
broken or buggy _ALx control. This may lead to sub-optimal thermal control.

/2014) and has assumed that your BIOS can correctly specify the host bridge MMIO
aperture using _CRS. If this does not work correctly you can override this by
booting with "pci=nocrs".

aspm: PCIe ASPM test.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 2: PCIe ASPM ACPI test.
PCIe ASPM is not controlled by Linux kernel.

ADVICE: BIOS reports that Linux kernel should not modify ASPM settings that BIOS
configured. It can be intentional because hardware vendors identified some
capability bugs between the motherboard and the add-on cards.


Test 2 of 2: PCIe ASPM registers test.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 00h:1Ch.02h L0s not enabled.
WARNING: Test 2, Device 02h:00h.00h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit
latencies, while providing substantial power savings. Disabling L0s of a PCIe
device may increases power consumption, and will impact the battery life of a
mobile system.

PASSED: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting matched was matched.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 00h:1Ch.03h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit
latencies, while providing substantial power savings. Disabling L0s of a PCIe
device may increases power consumption, and will impact the battery life of a
mobile system.

FAILED [MEDIUM] PCIEASPM_Unmatched: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting was not matched.
RP 00h:1Ch.03h has ASPM = 02h.
Device 03h:00h.00h has ASPM = 03h.

ADVICE: ASPM control registers between root port and device must match in order
for ASPM to be active. Unmatched configuration indicates software did not
configure ASPM correctly and the system is not saving power at its full
potential.

The kernel is using the ACPI MADT for SMP configuration information, so the
Multiprocessor Tables are not used by the kernel. Any errors in the tables will
not affect the operation of Linux unless it is booted with ACPI disabled.

NOTE: Since ACPI is being used in preference to the Multiprocessor Tables, any
errors found in the mpcheck tests will be tagged as LOW errors.

Failed to find the Multiprocessor Table data, skipping mpcheck test.
NOTE: Since the ACPI MADT is being used instead for SMP configuration, this is

fan: Simple fan tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 2: Test fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device0 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 1.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device1 of type Fan has max cooling state 1 and
current cooling state 1.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device2 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device3 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device4 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
PASSED: Test 1, Fan cooling_device5 of type Processor has max cooling state 3
and current cooling state 0.
FAILED [MEDIUM] NoFanCurState: Test 1, Fan present but has no cur_state present.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device2 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device3 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device4 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device5 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device
states. It could be that the devices are returning static information back to
the driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware
using System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined
may not work anyway.
