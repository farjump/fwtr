--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.
Kernel message: [ 0.044189] ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure but a warning from the kernel. The
MSR_IA32_ENERGY_PERF_BIAS was initialized and defaulted to a high performance
bias setting. The kernel has detected this and changed it down to a 'normal'
bias setting.

Kernel message: [ 0.171564] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored

ADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel. The
_OSI() method has implemented a match to the 'Linux' query in the DSDT and this
is redundant because the ACPI driver matches onto the Windows _OSI strings by
default.

Kernel message: [ 0.178742] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S1_] (20150619/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S1 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S1 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S1 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

Kernel message: [ 0.178750] ACPI Exception: AE_NOT_FOUND, While evaluating Sleep
State [\_S2_] (20150619/hwxface-580)

ADVICE: The exception comes from kernel cannot find _S2 namespace object that
contains the register values for the sleep state when kernel would like to setup
all the sleep state information. This means that the kernel does not know how to
enter the S2 sleep state, however, it should not be a problem if the S2 sleep
state isn't supported intentionally.

FAILED [HIGH] KlogOscInvalidUuid: Test 1, HIGH Kernel message: [ 0.188682]
\_SB_.PCI0:_OSC invalid UUID

ADVICE: The _OSC method indicates it has been passed an invalid UUID, see
section 6.2.10 _OSC (Operating System Capabilities) of the ACPI specification
for more details. Note that it has been observed on some systems that this error
is returned because the _OSC has evaluated incorrectly and it returns with an
incorrect error setting the OSC invalid UUID error bit.

ADVICE: ACPI AML intepreter has found some non-conforming AML code. This should
be investigated and fixed.

FAILED [LOW] KlogAcpiSystemIOConflictLpcIchWatchDogTimer: Test 1, LOW Kernel
message: [ 29.126340] lpc_ich: Resource conflict(s) found affecting gpio_ich

ADVICE: A resource conflict has occurred between ACPI OperationRegions and the
same I/O region used by the lpc_ich driver for the General Purpose I/O (GPIO)
region. Sometimes this GPIO region is used by the firmware for rfkill or LED
controls or very rarely for the Embedded Controller System Control Interrupt.
This may require deeper inspection to check if the conflict will lead to any
real issues. However, in the vast majority of cases this warning can be ignored
as no harm will occur.

Found 6 unique errors in kernel log.

PCIe ASPM is controlled by Linux kernel.

Test 2 of 2: PCIe ASPM registers test.
WARNING: Test 2, RP 00h:1Ch.02h L0s not enabled.

ADVICE: The ASPM L0s low power Link state is optimized for short entry and exit
latencies, while providing substantial power savings. Disabling L0s of a PCIe
device may increases power consumption, and will impact the battery life of a
mobile system.

FAILED [MEDIUM] PCIEASPM_Unmatched: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting was not matched.
RP 00h:1Ch.02h has ASPM = 02h.
Device 02h:00h.00h has ASPM = 03h.

ADVICE: ASPM control registers between root port and device must match in order
for ASPM to be active. Unmatched configuration indicates software did not
configure ASPM correctly and the system is not saving power at its full
potential.

PASSED: Test 2, PCIe ASPM setting matched was matched.

required features and errata updates for the processor.
The kernel did not report that CPU 0 has had a microcode update. The current
firmware is revision 0x28 and probably has not been updated.
The kernel did not report that CPU 1 has had a microcode update. The current

pages 233-238 of PCI System Architecture, Fourth Edition, Mindshare, Inc.
(1999). NOTE: The PCI IRQ Routing Table only really knows about ISA IRQs and is
generally not used with APIC. 

Could not find PCI IRQ Routing Table. Since this table is for legacy BIOS
systems which don't have ACPI support this is generally not a problem.

mpcheck: MultiProcessor Tables tests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The kernel is using the ACPI MADT for SMP configuration information, so the
Multiprocessor Tables are not used by the kernel. Any errors in the tables will
not affect the operation of Linux unless it is booted with ACPI disabled.

NOTE: Since ACPI is being used in preference to the Multiprocessor Tables, any
errors found in the mpcheck tests will be tagged as LOW errors.

Failed to find the Multiprocessor Table data, skipping mpcheck test.
NOTE: Since the ACPI MADT is being used instead for SMP configuration, this is
not a problem.

FAILED [HIGH] SyntaxCheckIASLCompilerAborted: Test 1, Compilation aborted early
due to a parser detected syntax error.

ADVICE: Some subsequent errors may not be detected because the compiler had to
terminate prematurely. If the compiler did not abort early then potentially
correct code may parse incorrectly producing some or many false positive errors.

possible that one thread enters the method and blocks and then a second thread
also executes the method, ending up in two attempts to create the object and
causing a failure.

ADVICE: (for Warning #3104, ASL_MSG_RESERVED_NO_RETURN_VAL): A reserved method
returned a value however it is not expected to return anything, so this does not
conform to the expected behaviour. The kernel will most probably ignore the
return value, so this is not going to produce any run time errors.

FAILED [LOW] MCFGMMIONotReserved: Test 1, MCFG MMIO config space at 0xf8000000
is not reserved in the memory map table

ADVICE: The PCI Express specification states that the PCI Express configuration
space should be defined in the MCFG table and *maybe* optionally defined in the
UEFI run-time service memory map if ACPI MCFG is present. Linux checks if the
region is reserved in the memory map table and will reject the MMCONFIG if there
is a discrepency between MCFG and the memory map table for the PCI Express
region. [See arch/x86/pci/mmconfig-shared.c pci_mmcfg_reject_broken()]. It is
recommended that this is defined in the UEFI run-time service memory map table
for Linux.


Test 2 of 2: Validate MCFG PCI config space.
PASSED: Test 2, PCI config space verified.

and current cooling state 0.
FAILED [MEDIUM] NoFanCurState: Test 1, Fan present but has no cur_state present.

Test 2 of 2: Load system, check CPU fan status.
Test how many fans there are in the system. Check for the current status of the
fan(s).
Loading CPUs for 20 seconds to try and get fan speeds to change.
Fan cooling_device0 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device1 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device2 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.
Fan cooling_device3 current state did not change from value 0 while CPUs were
busy.

ADVICE: Did not detect any change in the CPU related thermal cooling device
states. It could be that the devices are returning static information back to
the driver and/or the fan speed is automatically being controlled by firmware
using System Management Mode in which case the kernel interfaces being examined
may not work anyway.
